Caveats
Running your jobs under a different group can cause some interesting debugging problems. ptrace functionality may not work correctly:


$ gdb ./prog -p 1234
...
ptrace: Operation not permitted.

$ strace -p 1234
attach: ptrace(PTRACE_ATTACH, ...): Operation not permitted
This is because ptrace expects the UID and primary GID to match that of the target process. To debug a job running as group fslg_MYGROUP, run newgrp fslg_MYGROUP. This will place you in a new shell with fslg_MYGROUP as your primary group (compare `id` output before and after). gdb and strace should then work with -p.
