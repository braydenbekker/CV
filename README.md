About Me
---------

2016-2020 (expected)
:   **Bachelors Physics**; Brigham Young University (Provo)

I am an undergraduate at Brigham Young University studying Physics. I joined the Materials Simulation Group (MSG) My freshman year after Dr. Hart presented the group's research in Physcs 191. During my time in the group I have developed programming skills in C++ and python, learned good coding practices, and learned how to work together with a team to find solutions to important problems. 

Projects
----------

**Many Body Tensor Representation:**

My current research is with the recently proposed [Many Body Tensor Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.06439) (MBTR) for atomic systems. This method interpolates the materials space to achieve accurate results at a fraction of the computational cost of existing methods. My project researches the application of MBTR for representing binary/ternary alloys and using machine learning to predict new materials at a faster rate.

* [Project Impact](https://github.com/braydenbekker/EAM-MBTR/blob/master/README.md) gives an overview of the scope and purpose of my research 

* [Project Context](https://github.com/braydenbekker/EAM-MBTR/blob/master/Context.ipynb) is an interactive ipython noteboook with walks throughs and explanations of my methodology.

* [Project Results](https://github.com/braydenbekker/EAM-MBTR/blob/master/RESULTS.ipynb) reviews current progress and or results and what my work has contributed.
